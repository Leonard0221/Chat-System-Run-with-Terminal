# Chat System - Run with Terminal

This is a simple structure of a chat system that can be run in the terminal. It includes various functions, such as basic chatting, history searching, and entertainment options like Gobang and Minesweeper. Currently, efforts are underway to create a GUI to enhance the user experience.

## How to Utilize

1. Download all the files and folders from the repository.
2. Run `chat_server.py` to start the chat server.
3. Run `client_state_machine.py` to launch a client.
4. To run multiple users simultaneously, open `client_state_machine.py` multiple times.

**Note**: There was initially a translation package, but Googletrans is no longer functioning, so it has been removed. The translation function will be re-uploaded once an alternative solution is found.

## Features

- Basic Chatting: Communicate with other users through the terminal interface.
- History Searching: Retrieve chat history to review previous conversations.
- Entertainment Options: Enjoy playing Gobang and Minesweeper during downtime.
- In-Progress GUI: Enhancements are being made to provide a more user-friendly graphical interface.
