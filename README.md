# Chat-System-Run-with-Terminal
This is a simple structure of chat system, it could be run n terminal, it includes various functions including basic chatting, history searching, entertainment (Gobang, and Minesweeper), I have been working on doing a GUI for this platform to make it fancier.
How to utilize it:
1. Download all the files and Folders;
2. Run chat_server.py;
3. Run client_state_machine.py;
4. If you wanna run more than 2 users simulteanously, open the file client_state_machine.py specific number of times.

P.S. There is supposed to be a translation package, but Googletrans seems not working anymore, I delete it, hoping I will upload the function as soon as possible...
